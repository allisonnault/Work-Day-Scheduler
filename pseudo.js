// a whole day (9am - 5pm) = 9 rows/3 col in each (look at bootstrap)
            // first column: time
            // second : description = text area
            // 3rd: button -> saves to local storage 
    // create HTML for time blocks
    // event listener for each

// get current time

// 3rd button to save to storage
    // event listener (for the buttons on each row)
    // saves text to local storage 
    // load any saved data from local storage (getItem)
            // look at html text area for the description 
    

    
// current date is coming from Day.js library --- will need the CDN
    // paste just above the js link at the bottom of html
    // read the documentation to figure out how to manipulate it
        // can be used to update the hours

// background color needs to change based on past/present/future
    // if currentHour > timeBlock (set class to past = grey background)
            // else if currentHour < timeBlock (set class to future = green) background
                // else (set class it as present = red background)
